<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gallant exploits of the Czecho-Slovak
army in Siberia won the attention and sympathy
of the world to and for their hopes and
sacrifices in the cause of freedom. Fighting
the Germanic Powers was not a new thing to
them. Bohemia, the chief of the Czecho-Slovak
states, has always been the battlefield
between Slav and Teuton. All that of which
Bohemia is proud to-day was won inch by inch
through incessant struggle, through bringing to
bear every force of civilization possible, on the
German rulers. Bohemia's leaders emphasized
the need of education; and so effectually, that
Bohemia, to-day, ranks as one of the most
literate states of Europe. They emphasized
idealism, that not by brute force but by being
better fit should they eventually win. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
kept alive their faith in a renewal of Bohemia's
wonderful, romantic history, that the people
might not sink into despair from dwelling on
what their proud spirits held to be the degradation
of their position. They urged the development
of economic strength, and Bohemia
to-day is self-sustaining. Through ceaseless
battling for their rights, through pride in their
great accomplishment in the face of great obstruction,
the Czechs held their heads as high
as the inhabitants of independent lands. It is
an interesting fact that every poet, every musician,
every artist felt it his duty to devote his
art to his native land.</p>

<p>And here it might be well to state that the
Czech of Bohemia, although often called
Bohemian, has absolutely nothing in common
with the Bohemian meaning gypsy. This term
was once applied to some gypsies in France,
through a misapprehension that they came from
Bohemia. It clung even after the error was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
corrected. These particular gypsies really
came from Hungary, which however does not
mean that Hungarians or Magyars and gypsies
are one and the same. The gypsies, like the
Jews, do not belong to any one country.</p>

<p>Besides Bohemia, the Czecho-Slovak states
comprise Moravia, a rich farming country, the
birthplace of the great educator, John Amos
Comenius; a part of Silesia, famous for its
mines; and Slovakia, also rich in mineral wealth
which is largely undeveloped. Of these,
Slovakia suffered perhaps the most under the
scorn, oppression, and exploitation of the
Magyar oligarchy. Taxes in all the states
were high. Bohemia, especially, because of
its wealth, not only paid for itself, but helped
support unproductive Austrian German lands.
The language in all of these states is so closely
allied that the citizen of one can easily understand
the citizens of any of the others.</p>

<p>It is thought by some that Czecho-Slovakia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
will be a small country. This is not exactly
true, for it will rank eighth in size among all
the European states.</p>

<p>One thing that the Czecho-Slovaks have
particularly shown during the War, and which
argues well for their future, is their capacity
for self-government. Not only did they show
splendid organization in their efforts to secure
recognition, but when the time came to proclaim
the Republic, it was found that their
machinery was in perfect working order; and,
although great reforms have been inaugurated,
so far things have progressed with a smoothness
not to be found in any of the other newly-formed
states.</p>

<h2>Our Little Czecho-Slovak
Cousin</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>LAND OF PERSECUTION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was mourning in the little village
high up in the Tatras, as the Carpathian
Mountains are called by the Slovaks. Nine
men and women lay dead and four lay wounded
behind carefully closed doors of the little
homes. Scarcely a person except Magyar gendarmes
was to be seen on the one main street.
Now and then the curious, frightened face of a
child peeped out from behind the shaded windows,
and again quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>The day before, Magyar officers and priests
had come to consecrate the little square church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
that had just been erected. It had cost the
villagers many sacrifices, but they were proud
of it. They had come dressed in their best
and full of gayety to the services, never dreaming
but that their beloved Slovak pastor would
be allowed to assist. When they found, however,
that he had been ignored, they pressed
closely around those in charge and begged that
he be allowed to take part, that they might feel
that the church was actually their own.</p>

<p>Did they beg too hard? Was it because
they were loyal to a leader who loved and sympathized
with his own people? Was that why
Magyar guns suddenly boomed, and why the
ground lay covered with blood?</p>

<p>The news of the happening spread even to
the little village in the more fertile plains,
where Jozef lived. The twelve-year-old boy
heard it discussed the very next day as he accompanied
the haymakers to the fields. In
order to hear, he found it necessary to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
close to the men and women, for they spoke
only in half whispers, fearing spies sent out by
the Notary, chief officer of the Commune, who
seemed to count it among his duties to keep tab
on their very thoughts. They knew that they
could do nothing, and it gave them a cowed,
dejected air. Never had a haying been so
dismal.</p>

<p>The killing, dangerous as the topic was,
drew the men to the tavern at night. They
sat at the plain deal tables in small groups and
drank and smoked their long pipes. Now and
then one had something to say. Perhaps it
concerned the fate of some woman who had
resisted the officers during the mad effort at
Slovak denationalization in 1892, when forcible
transportation of children to purely Magyar
districts had been undertaken. Or it may
have dealt with the imprisonment of some
editor who had had the courage to denounce
some new injustice or atrocity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="352" height="500" alt="Men sitting at table in crowded room" />
<div class="caption">"'WILL A TIME NEVER COME WHEN WE SHALL BE FREE?'"</div>
</div>

<p>A tall athletic-looking man with a broad
smooth-shaven face, and hair worn rather long,
seemed to be listened to with greatest attention.
He was plainly from some other district, for
his attire was different from that of his companions.
It consisted of felt trousers, the
seams piped with red, a linen shirt and a sheepskin
waistcoat with the wool inside, heavily
embroidered on the leather side. His shoes
were of soft leather, laced with rawhide thongs
across the ankle, and he wore a low, black hat
decorated with a red ribbon band.</p>

<p>"I was living in Turciansky Sv. Martin, our
one national center, when the effort was made
to establish a cellulose factory there," he was
saying. "It was one of the many efforts on
the part of Slovaks to be more prosperous and
progressive. Like other citizens, I invested
considerable money in it. The building was
erected and the machinery installed and we
were awaiting our license from the government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when word came that it could not be
given to the present management. We were
dumbfounded, although we understood. We
were not to be allowed to run our own factory
because we did not help oppress our fellow citizens;
because we were loyal to our Slovak
traditions and to our Slovak land.</p>

<p>"We did not give in without making an
effort to secure justice. But, after several
months, we knew that we were defeated. During
all this time we had not been allowed to do
any work in the factory. One thing, finally,
the authorities permitted, and that was to run
the costly machinery once a week, so that it
should not grow rusty. Of course we had to
sell, and at a heavy loss to people eagerly awaiting
to develop what we had started."</p>

<p>The peasants near nodded their appreciation
of the conditions. One more excitable than
his fellows jumped up.</p>

<p>"Will a time never come when we shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
free? Will a time never come when the world
recognizes the crime of using force to make
people false to their own traditions?" he exclaimed.
"To outsiders the Magyars boast
of their liberal constitution, of the freedom
granted to other nations in the kingdom. We
who have no opportunities, who are not allowed
a single higher school of our own, nor even a
single Magyar Higher School where our
language is taught, know what a lie this is.
And what advantage is the Magyar language
to our children outside of Hungary? Go even
to Vienna or anywhere else in the monarchy,
and try to make yourself understood with it!
You'll see! And we were here before the
Magyars; we helped them to know the glorious
religion of Jesus Christ; we fought and bled as
well as they for our native land." Here his
voice changed curiously and a sort of exaltation
lit up his face as he said softly: "We must
have faith." Then he began to repeat some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
lines taken from the great Slovak poet Kollar's
"Slavy Dcera" (The Daughter of Slava).</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Stop! It is holy ground on which you tread.<br />
Son of the Tatra, raise your head toward heaven,<br />
Or rather guide your steps towards that oak tree,<br />
Which yet defies destructive Time.<br />
But worse than Time is man who has placed his iron scepter on thy neck, O Slava.<br />
Worse than wild War, more fearful than Thunder, than Fire,<br />
Is the man who, blinded by hate, rages against his own race."<br />
</div>

<p>Then again:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"He who is worthy of liberty, respects the liberty of all.<br />
He who forges irons to enslave others, is himself a slave.<br />
Be it that he fetters the language or the hands of others,<br />
It is the same, he proves himself unable to respect the rights of others."<br />
</div>

<p>And once more:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
<div class='poemwrap'>"Slavia, Slavia! Thou name of sweet sound but of bitter memory; hundred times divided and destroyed, but yet more honored than ever.<br />
</div><div class='poemwrap'>"Much hast thou suffered, but ever hast thou survived the evil deeds of thy enemies, the evil ingratitude also of thy sons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
</div><div class='poemwrap'>"While others have built on soft ground, thou hast established thy throne on the ruins of many centuries."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Here in a rich bass voice he broke forth into
the Slovak national song: "Nad Tatrou sa

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>MUSHROOM GATHERING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jozef's</span> home was one of the high-roofed
houses whose gable ends faced the broad,
whitish main street. It was made of unburnt
bricks, plastered outside, with hand-made
shingles on the roof. Each window was outlined
in pale green and the entrance porch was
quite ornamental, having a pretty conventional
design, also in green, painted around the door.
This, as well as the lines around the window,
was the work of Jozef's mother, who enjoyed a
certain reputation in the village because she
had once been asked to paint some borders
around the walls of the rooms of a girls' school
in the city of Brno, the capital of Moravia.</p>

<p>Behind the house were the stalls for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cattle and pigs, and, back of all, a small vegetable
garden, edged with sweet smelling herbs
and brightly colored flowers. This garden
ended in an alley way by a brook, surrounded
by green meadows in which geese usually
pastured.</p>

<p>In the center of the main street was the
Church, a small whitewashed building with a
square tower. Next to it were a cross and a
statue of the village saint.</p>

<p>Through the middle of the street were rows
of underground cellars, one belonging to each
family, in which it was possible to keep food
and milk ice cold. Vehicles made their way on
each side of these cellars.</p>

<p>Around the village were meadows dotted
with red poppies and blue corn flowers. Some
distance further were fields of potatoes, a few
vineyards, and a large, privately owned wood.</p>

<p>It was Helena, Jozef's cousin, who planned
the day in the wood for a mushroom hunt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
secured the necessary permission from the
forester in charge. She invited Jozef, his
ten-year-old sister Ruzena, and two of Ruzena's
girl friends to go with her.</p>

<p>"Goody!" the little girls shouted, and ran
for the permission which was readily granted
on the one condition that they do not spend all
the time in play but really bring home mushrooms,
which are highly valued as food.</p>

<p>First each little girl took her herd of geese
to the meadow by the brook, and left her flock
in charge of an old woman who had nothing
else to do but tend geese. Then they met
Jozef, who had finished his chores of feeding
the cattle and pigs, and Helena, who was older
and helped her mother at home. All were
dressed in old but bright colored clothes, and
all were barefoot and bareheaded, the girls'
corn-colored hair hanging in long braids down
their backs. All carried baskets in which now
lay a little lunch. When they started, Jozef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
did not walk beside the others, but ran on ahead
or lagged behind. He was afraid, since this
was a girls' party, that some of his boy friends
might call him a "sissy." He wouldn't have
been left out, however, for the world.</p>

<p>It was still early in the morning, but there
was already a heavy warmth in the air, so that
the coolness they found underneath the tall
trees when they reached them, was very welcome.
The road had been dusty, but here the
moss and grass were still wet with dew and gave
forth a fragrant, pungent odor.</p>

<p>The owner did not live in the wood, the only
buildings in it being the picturesque log cabin
of the forester or caretaker, and a beautiful
hunting lodge.</p>

<p>Soon the fun began.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Jozef, discovering two
mushrooms, or champignons, showing a brown
and a red head above the moss.</p>

<p>Such a scampering as there was among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
trees until every basket was filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>Here Etelka, the youngest of the party,
found one that she thought the prize of all. It
was red with white raised spots.</p>

<p>"Come here!" she cried. "I have found a
new kind. Shall I taste it?"</p>

<p>Helena took two rapid leaps toward her.</p>

<p>"Drop it! Drop it!" she exclaimed.
"That's a poison muchomurka. Never, never
taste anything of which you are not certain if
you don't wish to die."</p>

<p>"I thought it prettier than the red ones you
found," said Etelka, somewhat abashed.</p>

<p>"It is entirely different," and then Helena
showed her how it differed and again impressed
on all to confine themselves to those they knew.</p>

<p>Then the baskets were put down in a circle
and the children played hide-and-seek among
brown trunked firs with long gray mosses
festooned from branch to branch, knotted larch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
trees, and pines dripping with balsam. At
last, tired, they sank down on some netted roots
and ate their lunch of thick slices of rye bread
spread with goose fat.</p>

<p>"I found some sweet-root here once," Jozef
volunteered when they had eaten every morsel.</p>

<p>"Where?" the girls asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Jozef had very vague notions as to where.</p>

<p>"Let's agree," suggested Helena, "each to
give a nice mushroom to the one who finds
some sweet-root first."</p>

<p>All were willing, and with shouting, laughter
and song the search began. Several times
Jozef was quite certain that the prize was his,
but it was little Etelka who actually found
some underneath some blackberry leaves.</p>

<p>"I'm going exploring," Jozef now announced,
somewhat nettled that a girl should
have been the discoverer. Leaving the pathways,
he made his way down a long incline.
Not wishing to have the party separated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Helena led the others as best she could after
him.</p>

<p>It was a merry chase Jozef gave them, now
to the right, now to the left, then back in a
crazy circle. So intent were they in making
their way through some underbrush that they
were unprepared when, at a sudden turn, they
found themselves on the brink of the river that
they knew flowed through an edge of the wood.</p>

<p>Out of breath, they seated themselves in a
row on the bank and watched the waters glide
past. Then they threw in twigs, which they
called boats, and grew quite excited when some
of these became entangled in water washed
grasses.</p>

<p>"Oh, Helena," at last Etelka begged, as she
nibbled at her portion of the sweet-root,
"please tell us a story."</p>

<p>"A really truly Slovak fairy story,"
seconded Ruzena.</p>

<p>"Have it exciting," demanded Jozef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"And true," put in quiet, blue-eyed
Marouska.</p>

<p>Helena laughed. "Very well," she said,
"it'll be truly Slovak, and exciting, and as true
as any fairy tale can be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A SLOVAK FOLK TALE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once an old king who, knowing
that his end was nearing, called his son to him
and begged him to take a wife.</p>

<p>"I would fain see you settled before I die,"
he said.</p>

<p>The son knew not what to do, for of all the
maidens in his father's court there was none
that had especial charm for him. He was
thinking this over in the castle garden when an
old woman suddenly stood before him.
Wherever she came from, she was certainly
there.</p>

<p>"Pluck the three lemons on the glass
mountain and you will gain a wife such as next
to none possesses," she said. As she appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
so she disappeared. Her words, however,
sank into the youth's heart, and leaving good-by
for his father, he set out at once to find the glass
mountain and the magic lemons.</p>

<p>Far over wooded hill and dale he journeyed
but saw nothing even resembling a glass
mountain. At last, tired out, he threw himself
under a tree. As he did so, some ravens,
croaking loudly, flew out of its top branches.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought the Prince, "these may
direct me to where at least refreshment and
rest may be obtained." And starting again, he
followed in the direction that they had flown.</p>

<p>After three days and three nights he saw a
castle before him, and full of rejoicing, approached
it. It was entirely of lead and in the
door stood Jezibaba leaning on a leaden staff.</p>

<p>"Haste from here, good youth," she said,
"for nothing grows here, and when my son
comes home he will devour you."</p>

<p>"Nay, old woman," said the Prince, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
must not be, for I come with respect for his
power and knowledge, to seek his advice as to
how I am to reach the glass mountain on which
grows a wonderful lemon tree."</p>

<p>"Then I will help you," said Jezibaba, and
hid the Prince behind a big broom. As she
did so the castle shook, and peeping, the young
man saw an awful being come up brandishing a
leaden club.</p>

<p>"Yo, ho!" growled the ogre. "I smell
human flesh on which to feast."</p>

<p>"Nay, my son," cajoled Jezibaba, "a youth
is here, in truth, but only because he values your
advice."</p>

<p>"In that case," responded the giant, "let
him appear and I shall not hurt him."</p>

<p>The Prince came out, trembling, for he
reached only to the giant's knees; but being
brave of heart he courteously asked his
question.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah!" returned the giant, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
around as if searching for him. "I don't
know where it is, but if you go to my brother
in the silver castle, he may direct you. Here,
mother, give him some dumplings to last him
on his journey."</p>

<p>The Prince bit into a dumpling placed before
him and two of his teeth cracked, for the giant's
food was of pure lead.</p>

<p>"I shall eat them later," he said, and placing
three of them in his pockets, he thanked his
hosts and bade them good-by.</p>

<p>Again over hill and dale he traveled, until
wearied he sank as before under a thickly
branched tree. From the top of this tree
twelve ravens flew, and, remembering his
former good fortune, he followed in the direction
of their flight.</p>

<p>For three days and three nights he had
journeyed when he saw before him a castle
whose walls glistened in the sun. It was of the
finest silver and at the gateway stood Jezibaba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
leaning on a silver staff. He greeted her, saying,
"I come from the leaden castle and bear a
message for the owner here."</p>

<p>"In that case you are welcome, but that
harm may not come to you before my son
knows, let me hide you."</p>

<p>Soon after an ogre, more terrible than the
first, appeared brandishing a silver club. And
as he appeared the castle and ground were
shaken.</p>

<p>"Yo-ho!" said the giant, "I smell human
flesh for my meal to-day."</p>

<p>"Not so," spoke Jezibaba. "A youth is
here, in truth, but not to be harmed. He
bears a message to you from your brother of
the leaden castle."</p>

<p>So the Prince was invited to come out of his
hiding-place, which he did trembling, he seemed
so insignificant beside the ogre. He showed
the leaden dumplings in token that he spoke
the truth and the ogre's face grew quite mild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't tell you where the glass mountain
is," he answered to the query, "but my brother
of the Golden Castle will surely know. Take
him my greeting. Before you go, sit down
with us to our dinner."</p>

<p>But the dinner consisted of silver dumplings,
and excusing himself, the Prince placed three in
his pocket and went on his way.</p>

<p>Over wooded hill, through valleys he
journeyed, until weariness overcame him and he
sank down under a tree. Twelve ravens flew
from its top as he did so. The sight of them
revived his strength and he followed in the
direction they had taken.</p>

<p>After three days and three nights, before
him shone a castle of gold so bright as to rival
the sun's rays. Here Jezibaba, leaning on a
golden staff, received him, and here he saw her
son the ogre.</p>

<p>"If my brother of the silver castle has not
harmed you, neither shall I harm you. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
do you wish of me? Ah, the glass mountain!
I know it well. Travel straight to the north
and you will come to it. On its top you'll find
the lemon tree with fruit so fragrant that it
scents the air for miles around. If this fruit is
meant for you, it'll drop into your hands of its
own accord. If you need food or drink on your
homeward trip, cut open a lemon and all of
your needs will be satisfied. Now come and
eat with us before you leave."</p>

<p>But the meal was all of dumplings of gold
and, when the Prince saw them, he urged his
haste and would only accept some for his
journey.</p>

<p>He traveled straight to the north, and, after
three days and three nights, he came to a barren
spot in the center of which stood a hill of glass
and on it a tree with lemons whose fragrance
reached him long before he was near.</p>

<p>He tried to climb the slippery surface, but
with every step he slid back a step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly were he lighter, he thought, he
might finally succeed. So taking out a leaden
dumpling he threw it away. To his delight, it
stuck in the glass, making a step. He threw
out another higher up and then the third, up to
which he climbed. The silver dumplings followed,
and then the gold, and, with their aid,
he reached the mountain's top.</p>

<p>Sinking down on his knees under the lemon
tree, he held out his hands and the lemons
dropped into them one by one. As the last
fell, the tree and glass mountain vanished, and
how it happened he could not say, but he found
himself well started toward home.</p>

<p>He had still a long distance to go, and
hunger and thirst overcame him. Remembering
the gold ogre's words, he took a lemon
from his pocket and cut it open.</p>

<p>As he did so, a maiden so beautiful his eyes
were dazzled, leaped out and making a courtesy
inquired:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you food for me? Have you drink
for me? Have you fine dresses for me to
wear?"</p>

<p>"Alas," answered the Prince sadly, "I have
none of these."</p>

<p>The maiden courtesied again and instantly
vanished.</p>

<p>"Ah, I know now what manner of fruit this
is!" thought the Prince.</p>

<p>He could not bring the maiden back, so he
sipped the lemon and found it satisfied his
hunger and thirst marvelously. He was able
to walk a long way now, which was good, for
he saw neither food nor drink that day. But
toward evening of the next day his throat felt
so dry and his stomach so empty that he reluctantly
cut open the second lemon.</p>

<p>A maiden more dazzlingly beautiful than the
first jumped out of it, and, making a courtesy,
inquired as the first had done:</p>

<p>"Have you food for me? Have you drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for me? Have you fine clothes for me to
wear?"</p>

<p>"Alas," the youth sadly answered, "I have
none of these."</p>

<p>The maiden courtesied and vanished as completely
as the other had done.</p>

<p>He satisfied his hunger and thirst, but resolved
that come what might, even though he
had to crawl home for weakness, he would not
cut the third lemon until he reached there.</p>

<p>Nor did he, for his strength lasted him until
next day when he saw the walls of his city before
him. Already outside he was recognized;
the news spread, and the aged king sent out an
escort to meet him and conduct him into his
presence.</p>

<p>When the two had embraced, the Prince told
his wondrous story. A banquet was prepared
for the following day, to which many guests
were invited. Costly raiment, too, was made,
and brought into the palace walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>When the guests had assembled conscious
that some surprise was in store for them, the
Prince cut the third and last lemon. A maiden
of beauty so great that it surpassed the dazzling
beauty of both of the others, leaped lightly out
of it and, courtesying to the Prince, inquired:
"Have you food for me? Have you drink
for me? Have you fine clothing for me to
wear?"</p>

<p>"I have all of these," said the Prince
happily, presenting her with the costly gowns.</p>

<p>She put on the most elegant of these, and, so
much did it still further enhance her beauty,
that the Prince could not take his eyes from her
as he led her into the Banquet Hall.</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?" he whispered. And
when she smilingly nodded consent, he announced
the betrothal amid congratulations
and cheering. Shortly after the wedding feast
followed.</p>

<p>The young people were very happy until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
old king died and the Prince, having taken his
place, had to lead an army to War. Before
they parted, that harm might not come to his
Queen, a platform for her was erected high in
the air. No one could get on it unless the
Queen let down a silken cord.</p>

<p>Now, an ambitious gypsy maid begged the
Queen so hard to let her come up to comb and
braid her hair, that the Queen consented. The
gypsy talked and flattered as she combed, until
the Queen fell asleep, and then the girl killed
her by plunging a sharp pin into her head.</p>

<p>As the pin sank in, a snow-white dove flew
out. Nothing remained of the Queen except
her beautiful clothes, which the gypsy donned
and sat down on the throne.</p>

<p>When the King returned, he thought his wife
terribly changed and would have nothing to do
with her. He mourned incessantly for what
she once had been.</p>

<p>One day, as he walked sorrowing in the garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a snow-white dove lit on his hand. He
stroked its pretty feathers and as he did so, felt
a pin head on the top of its head.</p>

<p>"What is this!" he exclaimed, and drew it
forth.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done so, than his wife of
old stood before him just as he had first seen
her in her wondrous charm and beauty. She
told him all that had occurred. The wicked
gypsy was put to death and nothing further ever
came to mar the happiness of the heaven
married pair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE VOICE OF THE WOOD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was getting dusky in the woods when the
little party started reluctantly for home. The
birds were already chattering their good nights
before preparing for sleep and a belated
squirrel or two looked inquisitively down at
them.</p>

<p>Now and then one of the children found
berries that tempted even Helena to linger.</p>

<p>"I did not know there were so many yet,"
she remarked. "I must ask father to beg the
forester to let me come soon again for them
alone. Of course I shall take you all."</p>

<p>As the trees grew a little more scattered,
Ruzena, who had been walking lost in thought,
now raised her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old Susanna," she said, "told me once that
the trees talk, but I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"It's not the trees," said Jozef quickly, "but
the spirit of the woods who answers when you
call to him."</p>

<p>Putting his hand to his mouth, he shouted:
"O-ho! O-ho!" And from somewhere
came the answer "O-ho! O-ho!"</p>

<p>All the children looked back.</p>

<p>"Let me try," said Helena, smiling. Then
she shouted: "<i>Dobrou noc!</i> <i>Dobrou noc!</i>
Good night! Good night!"</p>

<p>"<i>Dobrou noc!</i> Good night!" came back as
before.</p>

<p>"It's a mocking spirit," said Marouska,
walking as close to Helena as she could.</p>

<p>"It's only the Echo Spirit," returned Helena,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" was returned from the
woods so clearly that Marouska seized Helena
by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the edge of the forest.
It was still day outside and Marouska soon
forgot that she had almost been really afraid.</p>

<p>She remembered it, however, the next day
when a heavy summer shower came with lightning
and thunder.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the spirit does when it
rains," she said to herself.</p>

<p>She thought of the birds and squirrels that
she had seen. Would the storm hurt them?
She asked her father when he came home after
it was all over. He smiled and said:</p>

<p>"I have to see Zerzan, the forester, about
something. You can go with me to see if any
birds are left."</p>

<p>How beautiful the wood looked when they
reached it! Every leaf sparkled, while the
birds sang far more than on the day before,
Marouska thought.</p>

<p>"You see," said her father, "that all nature
sometimes likes a bath."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the spirit of the wood, did he also
like it?" inquired Marouska with some
timidity. Then she told her father about the
voice that had answered their call.</p>

<p>"That's the Echo," said her father, and
whether it was because he could not explain it,
or whether it was because the forester just then
met them, he made no further explanations.
Thus it came about that Marouska kept her
bewildered first impressions for many a day
after.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>SUMMER</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We're</span> off! Good-by!" cheerily called
out four sturdy, red-cheeked girls, early one
morning. They were walking in pairs, with
bundles in their hands and their shoes slung
over their backs. They belonged to some of
the poor families of the village, and intended
tramping it to the richer plains to work on two
of the farms there, where their help would be
very welcome and well paid. Each had taken
food for the journey; rye bread, bacon, and a
cheese called <i>brindza</i>, made from sheeps' milk
by Slovaks in the mountains.</p>

<p>Everybody waved to the girls or had a
pleasant word for them as they passed by.
When the last house had been reached, their
voices rang out sweetly in song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
In vain is not thy toil,<br />
In vain is not thy faith;<br />
The Lord God in the Heavens<br />
Gathers all of labor's sweat.<br />
</div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Songs, songs, whence come ye?<br />
Descended from the heavens<br />
Or grown in the woods?<br />
<br />
Not down from the heavens<br />
Nor grown in the woods,<br />
But born in the hearts<br />
Of maidens and youths.<br />
</div>

<p>Then the more melancholy strain:</p>

<div class='poem'>
My lips are singing,<br />
My eyes are smiling,<br />
But tears stream from my heart.<br />
</div>

<p>Ruzena half envied them as she listened.
Everybody at her house, except her baby
brother and herself, had left for the hay-field
to help with the mowing. She had
not yet taken the geese to pasture, and as she
started off, brother tried to toddle after
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, you may go with me to-day," she
said good-naturedly, lifting him up in her
strong arms and carrying him to the alleyway.
But it is not easy herding geese that try to
stray and carrying a heavy baby at the same
time. Although the distance was not great,
Ruzena found that it was more than she could
do.</p>

<p>"I must leave you here," she said, panting,
and put baby down by the roadside. "Now be
good and play and sister will hurry back."</p>

<p>Juraj was always good, and although he
looked a little wistful, made no complaint.
Perhaps he was used to being left in that
fashion. He had nothing on his little body
except a short shirt; but on his head, according
to custom, he had a most elaborately embroidered
cap or rather hood. He sat patiently
still for a while; then a big black beetle made
him struggle to his feet. He reached forward
to get it, turned a summersault, and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
time he had straightened himself up, the beetle
had disappeared in the grass.</p>

<p>Juraj looked around for it and then catching
sight of the brook near by, half walked, half
crawled to it. There were all sorts of things
to interest him here, and, without a moment's
hesitation, he walked right into the middle and
sat down with something of a thump on the
stony bottom. Even then he did not cry, but
tried to reach the funny little water insects that
scurried so fast everywhere about him.</p>

<p>"Juraj, Juraj, why, you're all wet!" exclaimed
Ruzena, snatching him up when she returned.
Then Juraj for the first time cried,
just a plaintive little cry that seemed to
ask why he must give up so innocent a pleasure.</p>

<p>He was tight asleep in his own little cradle,
that had served two generations of children,
when Ruzena heated some food that her
mother had prepared, put it into a pail, filled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
jug with fresh water, and started with these for
the hay-field.</p>

<p>Some of the mowers were still being followed
by barefoot women and girls in bright-colored
skirts, who tossed the hay over their heads and
shoulders. Others were already sitting and
lunching in the shade of the lumbrous wagons.
Large cream-colored oxen, with very long
horns, stood unyoked near by.</p>

<p>Ruzena's mother returned home with her
daughter, for neighbors had come over to help,
and although she had baked all the day before,
she felt anxious lest something should be lacking
on the supper table.</p>

<p>It was just getting dusk when the sound of
singing, not boisterous, but low and sweet, came
from the road and announced the hay-makers.
With their heads crowned with grain, they
walked beside or stood in the clumsy wagons
drawn by sleepy-looking oxen with poppies and
corn flowers wound around their horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>How good the things did taste after the hard
work! Ruzena helped her mother wait on the
guests, and as a treat, was allowed to go with
them to the tavern where they danced their own
national dances until the church bell rang out
midnight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>VILLAGE INCIDENTS</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">R-r-r-rub-rub-rub!</span>" went the little drum
beaten by the bailiff as he stalked through the
village. Every one hurried to door or window
to learn what the news might be. It would
not have created much stir in a city, but it did
create quite a stir in the double row of houses.</p>

<p>"Beran's cow, in your very next village,"
announced the bailiff, "stepped into a hole
and broke her leg at noon to-day, so that she
had to be killed. If you want fresh meat,
here's your chance."</p>

<p>When the bailiff had gone from end to end
of the street and back again shouting the news,
he was surrounded by people anxious to know
the particulars: just where the accident had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
occurred; how the cow happened to step into
the hole; who first found it out; who killed her;
and many other things.</p>

<p>Almost every one wanted some of the meat,
and several of the men set out that very evening
to secure a share.</p>

<p>The next day Ruzena drove the geese to
pasture in the hay stubble where they were
always taken that no grain might be wasted,
when the hay was already in the barn waiting
to be threshed. When she returned, she found
that a wandering tinker with mousetraps, rolls
of wire and mending material slung over his
back, was making his yearly visit.</p>

<p>The tinker's native place, like that of many
another Slovak tinker, was Kysuca, near the
Silesian border. It was not from there, however,
that he had just come, but from Nytra,
a place of twelve thousand inhabitants, once the
capital of the great Moravian Kingdom under
Svatopluk, of which Slovakia was an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
part. There was scarcely a door at which he
did not stop, not merely to do some tinkering
but to deliver messages from distant friends or
relatives, or to relate what was going on in the
greater world. He had been as far as Bohemia
in his year's travels, and had much to say of
that prosperous and progressive country. His
opinions, though sometimes crude, were listened
to with respect.</p>

<p>"When I first started making my rounds
twenty years ago," he said, "I used to stop for
a day or two with my wife's cousin in Praha
(Prague). Then the Germans had succeeded
in getting all the business into their hands; but
now the Czechs have got it all back again.
The banks, too, are almost all Czech. There
is hardly a German sign to be seen anywhere.
Every street has its own Czech name; but how
the Czechs had to fight for this, and how sore
the Germans are over it! The Czech believes
in fighting for the right, he believes in educating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
his children, he is willing to make any sacrifice
that will make Bohemia his own again. We're
a different people; we are too ignorant to know
how to go about things, and when we do know
we're so mild we don't do it."</p>

<p>"Much good fighting would do us!" remarked
Stefan the blacksmith. The other men
laughed. "Come and show us how," they
said.</p>

<p>"I don't mean fist fighting," the tinker returned
half angrily. "I mean fighting with
brains. Why can't we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right," interrupted a young man,
his face all aflame, as he stepped into the ring.
"But what chance have we to develop our
brains when we haven't a single Higher School
where the Slovak language is taught? When
every opportunity is cut off from one if he somehow
manages to educate himself, unless he turns
traitor to his mother tongue and swears that
he is a Magyar? Don't I know? Didn't I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hope to work myself up into a position where I
could serve my nation? And you know my
record. Imprisonment and imprisonment and
imprisonment. The Czechs are helping themselves,
but no progress will come for us until
the world at large will awaken to its duty of
preventing tyranny and exploitation."</p>

<p>"True!" muttered many of the men; and
then slipped away one by one as some one
pointed out the Notary approaching in the
distance.</p>

<p>An old woman now engrossed the tinker's
attention. She was quite a character in the
village and some of the people would have
agreed that she was the chief character. No
one called her by her name. She was
"Aunty" to everybody for miles around. In
sickness and death, in birth and rejoicings, her
advice was sought, even sometimes before that
of the village priest. She generally carried a
basket of herbs on her arm, for she was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hunting for some or ready to distribute some to
others. She knew their virtues as no one else
did.</p>

<p>Ruzena chose that moment to bring out an
earthen pot to be wired. She hoped the tinker
would be so busy talking to "Aunty" that he
would forget to indulge in his favorite pastime
of teasing.</p>

<p>But no sooner did she come up than he looked
at her seriously to ask: "Have you caught
any birds this year by sprinkling something on
their tails?" And when Ruzena smilingly
shook her head and said shyly, "None," he
wanted to know where a dog goes when he
follows his nose.</p>

<p>When at last he handed back her pot so skillfully
mended that it was, as he claimed, as good
as new, he said more seriously than before:</p>

<p>"His lordship in the next village has commanded
me to bring him a new kind of strap,
and I think that one of your braids of hair will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be just the thing for it. Stand still just a
moment while I find my shears."</p>

<p>But instead of standing Ruzena was running
home, half afraid that the funny tinker might
really cut off the hair. And as she ran she
heard him sing the first part of a folk song that
he had just learned from some peasants in the
neighboring brother land of Moravia:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"M&mdash;m, m&mdash;m, two mosquitoes married to-day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">M&mdash;m, m&mdash;m, not a drop of wine have they."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Does the tinker go all over the world?"
Ruzena asked her mother, humming the tune
that her quick ear had caught.</p>

<p>"M-mm, yes," her mother answered rather
absent-mindedly. She was busy preparing the
supper which the tinker was to eat with them.</p>

<p>"He does his wiring well," she said as she
put down the pot he had fixed. "He's somewhat
rattle-brained, I think sometimes, but he
learns a lot more going around than if he stayed
here. He hasn't come from any distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
country to us. Only from Nytra. You might
ask him about that place. If we don't get him
started on something else he will bring up the
Czechs again and what they're doing and what
we're not. Since we can't do anything, it's no
use repeating all that."</p>

<p>Ruzena remembered when all were seated at
the table, and asked the tinker if he would tell
them something about Nytra.</p>

<p>"I learned in school," she concluded
proudly, "that it was the capital of the great
Moravian Kingdom."</p>

<p>The tinker looked pleased. "Yes, under
Svatopluk," he said. "Then we had nothing
of which to be ashamed. But do you know
anything about that Svatopluk?"</p>

<p>Ruzena shook her head.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said the tinker kindly.
"There's some grown people in this village that
don't know any more. Do you know?" and
he turned to Jozef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Jozef hurried to swallow the food in his
mouth.</p>

<p>"I know the kingdom all went to smash after
he died," he shouted more loudly than he intended.</p>

<p>His father and mother exchanged pleased
looks.</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" asked the tinker.
"You don't? Well, I'll tell you as I heard a
priest tell it to some boys.</p>

<p>"When Svatopluk knew he must die, he
called his three sons to him. He selected the
eldest to rule after him. The two younger to
whom he left large estates, he bade be loyal to
their brother.</p>

<p>"At his orders, a servant brought in three
stout twigs fastened tightly together. 'Break
this,' he said, handing the twigs to his oldest
son. But the Prince found it impossible.
Then he handed it to the second son and then
to the third, but the twigs remained unbroken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Cut the cord,' he ordered the servant.</p>

<p>"This was done and Svatopluk handed a
twig apiece to each of the princes.</p>

<p>"'Now break it,' he commanded. This
each one easily did.</p>

<p>"'Here you see,' he said, 'that when three
stick closely together nothing can injure them,
but when they fall apart it is easy to destroy
them entirely. So will it be with you. Remain
united, working in harmony and forgiving
one another, and your enemies will find it impossible
to overcome you. But live divided,
and you will not only fight among yourselves
but your neighbors will master each of you.'</p>

<p>"Alas, what he foretold would come with
dissensions, did come. Foolish, selfish ambition
destroyed the foundations of this mighty
kingdom which included Moravia, Slovakia,
Poland, Silesia, northern Bohemia, and a large
part of northern Germany."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>AN ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Saturday and Ruzena had just returned
to the village from some distance outside
of it. She brought back some of the red
sand that was prized highly for sprinkling over
the hard earthen floors of the house. She
spread it carefully and then went into the
kitchen to help her mother with the baking for
the morrow.</p>

<p>Sunday was a blessed day in more ways than
one for the villagers. No matter how hard the
work of the week had been, the Sabbath
afforded relaxation. Everybody who could
went to church, and exceedingly attractive did
they look when they trooped out in twos and
threes after the service. The women especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
looked like a bevy of bright flowers in their gay
attire.</p>

<p>There is no one national costume in Slovakia.
It varies from district to district. Here the
women wore a snowy chemise with short puffed
sleeves ending in a wide ruffle. Above this
ruffle was a pretty band of hand embroidery in
orange-colored silk. Over this chemise was a
bodice. The heavily starched skirt was full
of tiny carefully arranged pleats with another
skirt of transparent flowery material, also
pleated, worn over, each pleat in this upper
skirt being fitted into that of the skirt beneath.</p>

<p>The men were quite as picturesque in high
boots, and close-fitting trousers of black cloth
embroidered in black and yellow. Over the
shirt, a short sleeveless waistcoat was worn,
fastened with one button. The two rooster
feathers at the back of the men's hats gave
them something of a dashing air.</p>

<p>The young men and boys always took their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
seats near the door. The older men sat at the
right of the aisle, the older women at the left.
The finery of the young married women and of
the girls did not allow them to be seated. The
former stood in the aisle, the latter in rows
near the altar. When they knelt down their
skirts stood out so far on every side that no
one could come near.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the young people paired for
a dance at the pavilion in the tavern grounds;
the children wandered off for play, while the
older folks visited at one another's houses or
met in the tavern to talk over the little happenings
of the week.</p>

<p>Wherever Ruzena was, Etelka and Marouska
were also apt to be. On this particular
Sunday the three had an adventure that gave
them all, but especially Etelka, who was the
most imaginative, quite a little thrill.</p>

<p>It was all because Jozef and one of his
friends, Janik, had insisted on following the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
little girls about, twitching their long hair and
playing all sorts of tricks on them. When
something called the boys away for awhile,
Ruzena exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I wish we could hide from them!"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a good place," suggested
Etelka; "let's go into our storeroom. Father
put a lantern down there and we can light it
and wait until the boys give us up."</p>

<p>Marouska and Ruzena thought this just the
thing, and away the three hurried to the underground
cellars. Every one was busy with his
own affairs, so no attention was paid to them,
and they climbed down the ladder into the dugout
belonging to Etelka's parents, without being
seen. Etelka lit the lantern and then
propped up the door slightly as she had seen
her mother do. The girls stood waiting and
listening.</p>

<p>At last they heard boys' voices. "It's Jozef
and Janik," whispered Ruzena. Whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was or not, the voices grew fainter and soon
could not be heard.</p>

<p>"They've passed, but if we go out they'll
find us," said Marouska in her quiet, sad little
voice.</p>

<p>Her two friends agreed. "But," asked
Ruzena, "what can we do here?"</p>

<p>Etelka's eyes sparkled. A bold plan had
occurred to her.</p>

<p>"Let's explore the secret passages," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Let's!" echoed her companions delightedly
yet fearfully.</p>

<p>"We won't go far," continued Etelka, knowing
that such explorations were considered
dangerous and forbidden. "Just a little
ways."</p>

<p>"Just a little ways!" Ruzena and Marouska
again echoed breathlessly.</p>

<p>These so-called secret passages were very old
and no one seemed to know for certain why they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had been built. The story generally accepted
was that they belonged to the time immediately
following the Hussite Wars, when many
Czechs were forced to emigrate to Slovakia.
While they were allowed to come, meetings to
study the Bible had to be held in secret. These
passages, connected with several of the cellars,
made such meetings possible. Although the
Slovaks in the village were now Catholics, they
had not forgotten stories of martyrdom and
courage handed down from those times. They
told how a pastor had traveled from village to
village hidden in a load of hay; of how a Bible
was once saved by being thrown down into a
well, and many other tales.</p>

<p>Taking the lantern, Etelka led the way into
a little opening. It did not go far, for the
earth had fallen down from the side walls, partially
blocking it.</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another.</p>

<p>"I know what we can do," suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Ruzena. "I saw an old board in the cellar.
We can dig some of the earth away with
that," and she ran to get it. She also brought
back a big wooden ladle, and with these unusual
implements, Marouska and Ruzena dug, while
Etelka held the lantern, until the obstruction
could be passed. There was comparative freedom
after that for quite a distance. At one
point the passage divided into three parts.
The girls chose to go into the broadest, but
scarcely had they gone twenty steps when the
light in the lantern went suddenly out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i076.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="Girls in carvern see men with light in distance" />
<div class="caption">"THE GIRLS HUDDLED TOGETHER, TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED TO MOVE"</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, dear, now we're in for it," burst from
Ruzena, as she felt Marouska catch tight hold
of her sleeve.</p>

<p>"Let's keep hold of one another and go
back," suggested Etelka, her voice trembling
slightly.</p>

<p>It was not easy, for they had to feel their
way along the wall. They became conscious,
too, that the air was bad. Once quite a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
earth fell down before them, but, fortunately,
not enough to hurt or stop them. It seemed
to them that they had been walking very, very
long, when Ruzena broke the silence that had
fallen, by volunteering:</p>

<p>"We must have come to where the passage
divides."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I wonder&mdash;" Etelka did not
finish, for Marouska clutched her wildly by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, look back," she whispered fearfully.</p>

<p>The girls turned. Coming behind them but
from another direction were two red lights evidently
carried by some person or persons.</p>

<p>The girls huddled together, too much frightened
to move.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ruzena gave a funny, relieved,
nervous laugh. "Why, if it isn't Jozef and
Janik!" she exclaimed aloud and then ran forward
and threw her arms about the astonished
boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you dears, how did you know that we
were lost?"</p>

<p>Jozef and Janik were surprised. They had
had no idea that the girls were in the cellar.
They had gone into Janik's storeroom for some
raw sour-kraut, and Janik had related how his
big brother had ventured quite a distance into
one of the passage-ways the week before.
"Let's go, too," had suggested Jozef. Both
boys had run home for some lanterns, never
dreaming that they should meet the girls.</p>

<p>"Huh," grunted Jozef, after Ruzena's embrace,
not yet comprehending. And when the
boys did comprehend, well&mdash;it was rather nice
to be treated like heroes! They listened to the
girls, but although they glanced sideways now
and then at each other, offered no explanations.</p>

<p>Then Jozef and Janik quarreled and while
waiting to make up, Jozef had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"The girls won't try this again," he communed
with himself, "and sometime I'll give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Janik a scare by going through our passage to
his. Perhaps I'd better store a little food in it,
for I might ask some of the other boys to come
in with me, and it'd be nicer to have some food
and play we're those old Hussites."</p>

<p>So, little by little, Jozef smuggled in food
of all kinds; some sugar, more wheat than several
boys could eat, sunflower and pumpkin
seeds,&mdash;the latter considered a particular
delicacy,&mdash;a small bag of raisins and nuts, a
handful of dried mixed fruit in a preserve jar,
and various other things.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>A VISIT TO "MATTHEW'S LAND"</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Other</span> things occurred so unexpectedly and
rapidly that boylike, Jozef forgot all about his
store of hidden food. Late in the Fall, most
of the children under twelve were back in
school.</p>

<p>Their home chores now had to be done on
Wednesdays, which, instead of Saturdays, were
their holidays, or before or after school hours.
Ruzena's favorite studies were embroidery,
drawing and painting, for, like most of the
peasants, she had inherited a decided art instinct.
Even her mother, who had never had
any lessons, had painted without patterns pretty
borders around the guest and living rooms;
while her father, also untaught, had made and
carved the two pretty chairs in the latter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
also the long shelf on which stood a fine array
of village pottery. Besides the work at school,
Ruzena also had crocheting, knitting, and embroidery
at home. It was mostly for herself,
for her mother had her follow the local custom
of beginning in childhood to work on her
trousseau.</p>

<p>There were other holidays from school work
besides the Sundays and Wednesdays, such as
Dusickovy Vecer, which comes in November,
the Slovak Memorial Day.</p>

<p>It was frosty and cold on this particular
memorial day; there were even some icicles
hanging from trees and bushes. A few flowers,
from indoor window gardens, and hundreds of
candles, had been placed and lit on the rude
graves. In their dim light, figures could be
seen kneeling and praying. Here the light fell
on an old man with a patient, gentle face, and
there on a young girl, her red skirts adding
color to the scene. Children were about, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
most of them in fur coats, and none of them
quiet for long. In the middle of the cemetery
a group of men and women were gathered
around a cross, while some one prayed. It was
an impressive occasion, and as the villagers
strolled homeward there was no loud singing
nor even talking.</p>

<p>After Dusickovy Vecer, Jozef and Ruzena
were taken by Jozef's godfather to a little village
far up in the beautiful Tatras, where life
was much more primitive and much harder
than in their own little rude village, the Magyar
Government showing no concern whatever in
the people's welfare.</p>

<p>On the way to this village, they crossed a
part of what the people around call "Matthew's
Land," because over it once ruled one of
the great figures of their history, Matthew
Csak, Lord of the Vah and Tatras, as he called
himself.</p>

<p>There are many castles in the mountains, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the most interesting was that actually inhabited
by Matthew in the early part of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Matthew's career was brief but remarkable.
He was a Palatine, holding the highest office in
the power of the King to bestow. He ruled
over what is now the greater part of Slovakia,
possessing enormous wealth, of which thirty
fortified castles were a small part. In these
castles he held court on a scale that rivaled
that of the King himself.</p>

<p>When the male line of the Arpad Kings of
Hungary became extinct, it was largely through
his influence that a Czech King, Vaclav II, was
called to the throne. Unfortunately, instead
of coming himself, Vaclav sent his son, then a
lad of thirteen.</p>

<p>To this the Pope, who had much to say in
politics in those days, objected, and the King
of Anjou, taking advantage of being preferred,
seized the throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Powerful nobles rose up in arms against him,
but the one he feared most was Matthew. He
tried his best to gain his favor, but in vain.
Then the Pope excommunicated Matthew, who
retaliated by burning a bishop's stronghold.
From everywhere nobles, zemans, and peasants
flocked to his standards.</p>

<p>The Anjou King now made peace with all
the other nobles, and resolved to direct his
efforts to crushing the chief rebel. Near the
little River Torysa, the armies of the two met.
The King's was enormous, and although the
Slovaks under Matthew fought bravely, they
were so greatly outnumbered that they were
defeated.</p>

<p>Although Matthew was defeated, he was
not reduced in rank. He retired for a time to
one of his castles, and then gradually assumed
his old powers, which he exercised to the day
of his death.</p>

<p>"Had Matthew succeeded in this rebellion,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Jozef's godfather concluded in telling the story,
"he might have laid the foundations of a successful
Slovak state, for the Slovaks at that time
still had in mind the part they had played in the
big Moravian Kingdom of Svatopluk."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>JOZEF GOES TO SCHOOL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A wonderful</span> opportunity now came for
Jozef. He was only twelve and had just completed
the course in the primary school.</p>

<p>"Jozef is bright. He is above the average
in his studies," the teacher told his parents.
"He ought to continue school work."</p>

<p>"I'd let him go on if we had schools of our
own, but I won't have him go to a Magyar
school to forget his language and learn to despise
his own kin like Shlachta's boy," his
father declared with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Better have him ignorant than false to his
birthright," his mother agreed.</p>

<p>The teacher nodded. He understood.</p>

<p>"If you could only send him to Bohemia,"
he suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"If," repeated the father grimly.</p>

<p>"What is this about Bohemia?" asked
Jozef's godfather, who had just come up. He
was a tall, thin, muscular man, whose hair hung
down his back in two tiny braids. He was
known for his liberal and somewhat "heretical"
opinions. "I am going there after the
holidays. Do you want to send some message?"</p>

<p>The teacher explained to him how things
stood. "If we don't educate our children,"
he pleaded, "the Magyars will take greater
and greater advantage of our ignorance."</p>

<p>Jozef's godfather stood a few moments in
thought. Then he nodded good-by and left.
The teacher was not put out. He was glad
that he was going to think it over.</p>

<p>The next morning the godfather was over at
Jozef's house bright and early.</p>

<p>"I've decided," he said, "that the teacher is
right. In Bohemia, Jozef will learn more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
about his own country than we can ever teach
him here and he'll learn to fight. I'll take him
with me and somehow we'll find means to pay
for his schooling there."</p>

<p>So, one day, Jozef found himself whirled
away on a train over the fertile farm lands of
Moravia, in parts of which there are many
Slovak villages, through Nivnitz, where the
great Moravian educator, John Amos
Comenius was born, through towns and hamlets
until they came to Brno, Moravia's capital.
They changed trains here, and Jozef had time
to see the Spielberg, crowned by a citadel long
used as a Government prison, with its horrible
torture cells, which throw some light on the
conception of humanity of the Hapsburg
Monarchy.</p>

<p>And then away again but not to Praha,
Bohemia's capital. Instead, Jozef's godfather
was bound for Tabor, one of the most interesting
towns of Bohemia, having been founded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
one of the great religious reform parties at the
outbreak of the Hussite Wars. This was the
town of Jan Zizka, the redoubtable military
hero of the times.</p>

<p>Jozef was full of questions regarding this
patriot and military genius&mdash;the greatest one
of his age. He learned that he is regarded by
many as the inventor of modern tactics, that he
organized peasants and mechanics so wonderfully
that they beat back and drove into despair
the best trained arm-clad knights of Europe;
that he never lost a battle; and that he probably
was the composer of a splendid hymn, "All
Ye Warriors of God," which seemed to inspire
his men with wonderful power as they sang it
marching to battle. At the battle of Domazlice
(Taus), which took place after Zizka's
death, 130,000 crusaders entered Bohemia,
proclaiming that they would not let a single
heretic live. They proceeded with plunder and
slaughter until they reached Domazlice, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
they pitched their camp. Some days after, the
report spread among them that the Hussites,
now under the command of Zizka's splendid
successor, Prokop the Great, were on their way
and that a battle was imminent.</p>

<p>While the Hussites were still four miles distant,
the crusaders heard the rattle of their
famous wagons and the mighty tones of the
hymn sung by the whole Hussite army. It
made such a terrible impression that the
fanatical soldiers fled before the song, even the
curses of the Cardinal failing to stop them.</p>

<p>Not knowing the passages of the gray
Bohemian mountain forest they were overtaken
by the Hussite vanguards; many thousands
were killed and many more taken prisoners.
Their camp with all the ammunition and provisions
fell into the hands of their captors. Thus
a song proved more mighty than the sword.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Fear not those, the Lord hath said,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Who would your body harm.<br />
For love of your fellowmen,<br />
He hath ordered you to die,<br />
Hence take courage manfully."<br />
</div>

<p>This great victory for a time put an end to
all efforts to make Bohemia betray her conscience.</p>

<p>Before Jozef's godfather left for home, he
told the boy another and beautiful story about
Prokop.</p>

<p>"Not only did Prokop repulse the enemy
when they invaded Bohemia, but he himself
made incursions into neighboring lands. Once
he led his army to the walls of Naumburg, in
German Saxony. The inhabitants were seized
with great terror for all counted on the town
being entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>"In the midst of the dismay, some one advised
the townspeople to send the children of
the town to the enemy's camp. 'It is possible,'
he said, 'that they may soften the leader's
heart.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"The people took the advice and the next
day four hundred and fifty children, gowned in
white, assembled before the Town Hall. Two
hundred armed citizens accompanied them to
the gate.</p>

<p>"When the children reached Prokop's camp,
they fell down on their knees before him and
begged him to spare the town.</p>

<p>"Prokop was deeply affected. He detained
the children until evening, treating them to all
the peas and cherries that they could eat.
When it began to grow dark he sent them home.
'Tell your parents,' he said to them, 'that I
will spare the town. But see that when you
reach the gate you shout: "Victory to the
Hussites!"'</p>

<p>"The next day the Hussites left the vicinity
without having harmed a single living thing.</p>

<p>"In memory of the event, the people of
Naumburg hold an annual festival in which the
children march to the spot where once stood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Hussite camp. Here they are treated to peas
and cherries. The occasion is called the
Hussite Cherry Festival."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>SCHOOL DAYS IN BOHEMIA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> arrangements had been made for
Jozef to live with some distant relatives, his
godfather bade him good-by.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i0096.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="two boys looking at tower" />
<div class="caption">"HE USED TO WANDER .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. TO THE FORTIFICATIONS"</div>
</div>

<p>"Learn all you can, the better to help your
native land," he said to him in parting.</p>

<p>It was not long before Jozef felt quite at
home. The boys at first teased him about his
dialect, but it was such good-natured teasing
that he did not mind it. Once when the
teacher overheard them, he said:</p>

<p>"Do not care. Your language may not be
as literary as ours, but it is softer and more
musical, and hence much more pleasing."</p>

<p>Jozef became very fond of the city. With a
"heretic" friend, he used to wander over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
curiously arranged, toothed old streets, to the
fortifications that still stand, or to the river
that surrounds the city on three sides. Or they
would stand and stare and discuss the statues of
Jan Hus, the religious martyr, of his marvelously
eloquent friend, Jerome of Prague, of
Jan Zizka, and of Prokop the Great. These
and many historic relics were in the odd, triple-gabled
Town Hall, finished in 1521, in the big
market square.</p>

<p>The statue of Zizka had an especial fascination
for them. They could see him walking
right there in the Square, surrounded by armed
warriors, looking just as here represented, with
expressive bent head, long mustache, and heavy
fur coat over his shirt of mail. In one hand
he held a sword, in the other, that terrible
weapon that they knew was once called by the
fanciful name of the morning star.</p>

<p>Besides the Town Hall there were other interesting
irregularly built buildings, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
peculiar ornamentation, in the Square. Before
one of them still stood one of the stone tables
on which the Taborites took communion in the
open air.</p>

<p>How very different Bohemia seemed to him
from Slovakia! Here every one was proud of
his nationality, which despite heavy taxes and
many other oppressions, the people had retained
through the efforts of great unselfish leaders
who ceaselessly battled for their rights. He
forgot the humility that he used to feel when
meeting a contemptuous Magyar. Soon he
held his head as high as the Czech boys did
when they came face to face with Germans who
through wrong training, in their wicked conceit,
looked upon every nationality not their own, as
far below them. In Tabor this was not at all
hard with all the voiceless eloquent teachers
around that reminded of past greatness and resistance
to injustice.</p>

<p>Jozef soon felt one of the family in the excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
home in which he boarded. Nothing
pleased the good-hearted house mother more
than his usually hearty appetite, and she seldom
failed to applaud it by some quaint folk saying,
as "A hearty eater is a hearty worker." She
had no patience with fussiness about selection
of food, and if she saw any would exclaim:
"He who is fussy about his food, may learn
to think any cheese would be good."</p>

<p>In the first days of his stay, Jozef accompanied
her once to a market day in the Square.
The farmers seemed to him to have brought a
little of every kind of food that one could wish
for. There was sweet home-churned butter,
cottage and other cheese, eggs, poultry, vegetables,
fruit, honey, mushrooms, poppy seed for
cakes, and grain of all kinds.</p>

<p>In school Jozef was now in what was called
the Lower Gymnasium. He had to be in the
school building, which was not far from his
boarding place, at a quarter to eight in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
morning. Sundays and Thursdays were holidays.
The school exercises began by all the
pupils repeating the Lord's Prayer and Ave
Maria. After that the time was devoted to the
regular studies. The classes were named by
Latin numerals, prima, secunda, etc. to octava.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock came a short recess, in which
the children of the Lower Gymnasium played
ball; those of the upper thought it below their
dignity to do so. Sometimes instead, the
pupils indulged in a little lunch by buying buttered
bread, cheese, or fruit from the janitor.</p>

<p>Whenever a Professor entered the room or
left it, all the children stood up as a sign of
respect.</p>

<p>Jozef soon came to share the devotion of the
children to the teacher, a man of delicate health
but great spiritual vision, who constantly called
the attention of the pupils to the idealism found
in Bohemian (Czech) history. Through him
the pupils learned, too, that Austria was largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
parasite, living on Czech wealth; that the
Czechs paid sixty-two per cent of all the taxes
in Austria to support passive non-Slav lands;
that eighty-three per cent of Austrian coal was
mined in Bohemia; that sixty per cent of the
iron was found there; that ninety per cent of
beet sugar factories were located there; that
textile and other industries were important.
They also learned that the renowned Bohemian
glass employs over fifty thousand workers;
that there are excellent highways, extending to
ten thousand miles, and several important railroad
lines; that one-third of all the gold and
silver mined in Hungary is mined in neglected
Slovakia. Jozef was particularly impressed by
the fact that despite all the discrimination of
the Government against the Czech schools, the
Czechs were by far the most literate people of
the monarchy.</p>

<p>History came to be Jozef's favorite study.
He devoted much time particularly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
glorious reign of Charles I, known also as
Emperor Charles IV, who probably did more
for Bohemia than any other monarch.</p>

<p>One of the teacher's favorites was King
George (Jiri) of Podebrad, sometimes called
the "Heretic King of Bohemia." Jozef did
not appreciate his full significance and was more
interested in the stories told of his jester, whose
name was Palecek.</p>

<p>Palecek was no ordinary jester. He was an
educated man of noble birth, who by playing
the fool could often tell truths other courtiers
dared not utter. Because he addressed every
one, even the King with his permission, as
"Brother," he himself came to be known as
"Brother Palecek." One thing Brother
Palecek felt as a particular duty was to keep
the King in lively humor, for the cares of state
were very heavy at the time.</p>

<p>Once the King gave a large dinner. At his
table sat the Queen, princes and princesses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the highest nobles of the realm. The younger
nobles and others who served the King sat at a
table apart. When Brother Palecek arrived,
he was not very well pleased at being placed at
this lower table. Soon he had another grievance;
big fish were being passed to the King and
those around him, while only little fish with
many bones, came to the table at which he sat.</p>

<p>Gaining the attention of those about him, he
took up one of the fish and held it to his ear
and asked it: "Little fish, do you know anything
about my brother?" and then placed it
down again.</p>

<p>Then he took a second fish and asked:
"Little fish, do you know anything about my
brother?" Again he laid it down and took up
a third.</p>

<p>The young people about him burst into
laughter, so funny did Palecek look while doing
this. The King asked what was amusing
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it please Your Majesty," one of them
answered, "Brother Palecek is conversing with
the fish."</p>

<p>"Brother Palecek," said the King, "what
are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Brother King," replied Palecek, "I'll tell
you. I had a brother fisherman who was
drowned in the river. So I am asking these
little fish if they know anything about him."</p>

<p>"And what do they tell you?" asked the
King.</p>

<p>"They tell me," returned Palecek, "that
they're still too young and small to know anything
about it, but that I'd better ask those
bigger, older fish that are on your table."</p>

<p>The King laughed and ordered the largest
fish of all to be placed on a dish and given to
Palecek. These the jester accepted gracefully
and shared, amid general good cheer, with all
at his table.</p>

<p>There were various boys' associations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
which Jozef was soon invited to attend or was
asked to join. One was a boys' orchestra. In
this land of music, it was very natural that all
who formed a part of it should have been enthusiasts.
As an encouragement to its members,
the orchestra received free tickets to all
the purely national concerts given in the city.
Thus Jozef came to know better the works of
the great Czech composers, Antonin Dvorak,
Bedrich Smetana, and Zdenko Fibich. He
thus also had an opportunity to hear Jan
Kubelik, the renowned violinist, and Emmy
Destinn, the prima donna.</p>

<p>Now and then the school children were
taken to a national art exhibit. One of Vaclav
Brozik, whose "Columbus at the Court of
Queen Isabella" is known to all American
children, and one of Alfons Mucha, known also
in America for his poster work, but renowned
in his own country in other lines as well, were
followed by one of Joza Uprka, the Moravian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Slovak, whose paintings of his beloved country
folks, with their riot of color, and his passionate
portrayal of the action and joy of life, made
Jozef for a time quite homesick for the simpler,
more picturesque life of his mother's home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>WAR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> world rang with the assassination of
the Austrian Archduke, Francis Ferdinand, and
his wife, at Sarajevo, in a province of Austria-Hungary,
but quite outside the Czech and
Slovak lands. It was a terrible deed with
which no law-loving people were in sympathy.
But when Austria, backed by Germany, seized
the killing as a pretext for declaring war on
little Serbia, both Czechs and Slovaks felt the
grave injustice, and despite all efforts made by
the Government, very few of them could be
induced to make any demonstration in favor of
the action. When Germany mobilized, there
was no doubt in the minds of any but that the
War was simply one against all the Slavs, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
opposed German possession of Middle Europe
and German and Magyar ideas of superiority
and power.</p>

<p>It was a hard time through which all the
Slavic people of Austria-Hungary had to pass.
It was hardest on those who, like the Czechs
and Slovaks, were forced to fight on a side that
they detested, against their own interests. In
the face of the terrorist methods employed,
their resistance and sacrifices are remarkable.</p>

<p>The Government feared them. No sooner
was war declared than Czech and Slovak
troops were sent from their home lands into the
Austro-Hungarian province farthest from
them, Transylvania, and foreign soldiers took
their places. German soldiers are said to
have patrolled Bohemia's borders.</p>

<p>It was during the first days that Prof. T. G.
Masaryk, on the advice of his colleagues who
understood how the War menaced the Czech
and Slovak lands, was fortunate enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
escape from the country with one of his
daughters. From then on until Czecho-Slovakia
was recognized, he worked incessantly
for Czecho-Slovak independence.</p>

<p>When Austria declared war, it did what no
other country taking part in the War did: it
declared war without first gaining the consent
of Parliament. It was a high-handed act
which the Czechs, in particular, resented.
Great gloom prevailed. In sympathy with the
principles of the Allies, knowing intimately the
world menace of Germany as few outsiders
knew it, the leaders were seeking means of protest
when one after another was thrown into
prison. Newspaper and magazine editors
followed in quick succession. But the people,
like the Hussites of old, stood firm in their faith
and determination to sacrifice all for the right
and to quietly resist in every way that promised
to be effectual.</p>

<p>Jozef saw the soldiers march off from Tabor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
with a look of peculiar resolve in their eyes, and
heard mothers and fathers whisper with their
good-bys:</p>

<p>"You know your duty to your native land."
When later he heard of patriotic soldiers shot
because refusing to go forward; of Czech and
Slovak soldiers branded as traitors because
they deserted to the Allies and, reforming in
their ranks, fought their real enemies, the Germans
of Germany, the Germans of Austria, and
the Magyars of Hungary, he understood better
what a big and splendid thing this duty was.</p>

<p>For a while, work in the school continued,
but everything seemed different. Patriotic
songs with their beautiful melodies were no
longer allowed to be sung; the old school books
with their brilliant, romantic, yet true recitals
of Bohemia's wonderful, heroic past, were replaced
entirely by newly written books full of
praise of the Hapsburg rulers and of Germany.
Jozef and the other pupils rejoiced in one thing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
they still had the same teacher. But this rejoicing
did not continue long. One day they
found the school doors closed and learned that
the teacher had been taken to prison accused of
disloyalty because he had allowed a ten-year-old
pupil to walk home humming the national
air, "Kde domov muj" (Where is my home?).</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Where is my home,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Where is my home?</span><br />
Waters through its meads are streaming,<br />
Mounts with rustling woods are teeming,<br />
Vales are bright with flow'rets rare,<br />
Oh, Earth's Eden, thou art fair!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou art my home, my fatherland,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou art my home, my fatherland!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>News of still more imprisonments and executions
followed daily. The older daughter of
Prof. Masaryk was imprisoned, mainly as a
punishment to her father, who was working so
hard against the Central Powers abroad.
Machar, one of the greatest poets of Bohemia,
shared the same fate because of a poem published
in the United States, without the poet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
consent&mdash;a poem passed many years before by
the Austrian censor!</p>

<p>Strange rumors spread. Once Jozef and his
particular friend, Jaroslav, walked out of the
city in the direction of Blanik, a mountain
around which are clustered many traditions.
They were overtaken and offered a ride by a
very old man.</p>

<p>"Who are you and where are you going?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We're students in the Lower Gymnasium,"
Jaroslav answered. "We're only out for a
walk, for there is no school. We're going
toward Blanik, but don't expect to get so
far."</p>

<p>"Better not," said the old man sternly.
"Who knows but the old tale may be true that
the Taborites never died but are hidden, as is
said, in a cave there. They were to reappear
at the time of Bohemia's greatest peril, you
know. This may be it. There're lights in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that mountain, I tell you; don't breathe a word
of it; but also don't go there."</p>

<p>Here he let the boys alight, and they walked
on speculating on the tradition and as to just
what the man meant by his last words.</p>

<p>"Do you think that some of the Czechs
go there to discuss things?" asked Jozef.
Jaroslav did not know what to think. Both
boys wondered and wondered whether some
great help might not come to Bohemia from
the mountain.</p>

<p>School did not reopen, and food became
very scarce. It seemed best that Jozef be sent
back to his home in Slovakia in any makeshift
way possible. This was done, and after a
week's hard and varied travel, he reached home,
almost starved. In Slovakia he found the
same persecution of all suspected of lack of
sympathy with the plans and purposes of the
Central Powers.</p>

<p>Four of his relatives had been taken to fight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of these two cousins had been killed, and one
was reported to have been shot with an entire
company that refused to advance against the
Serbians. No one knew where the fourth relative,
an uncle after whom Jozef had been
named, was to be found, until Austria-Hungary
was broken up and he returned home wounded.
He had a story full of exciting incidents to tell
and the villagers never tired of hearing it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i0116.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="Men and boy listening to story" />
<div class="caption">"THE VILLAGERS NEVER TIRED OF HEARING IT"</div>
</div>

<p>One day a load of miserable looking prisoners
passed in cars through the village. It was
terrible to see them as they lay listlessly against
each other. It was plain that it had been long
since they had had anything to eat or drink.</p>

<p>The villagers were forbidden to give them
food or to satisfy their thirst, but the kind-hearted
Slovak maidens found a way to help
nevertheless. How the idea spread not many
of the girls knew, but there was a sudden interchange
of knitting material. It must have contained
a message, for the girls, far thinner than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
they had been before the War, met before the
Church and proceeded past the cars in a body,
as if to view the horrible sight. But most of
them raised their eyes only for a moment. It
was when each threw some crusts of bread
soaked in wine in to the famishing prisoners&mdash;bread
that each had denied herself from her
own scanty allowance.</p>

<p>The prettiest girl of all blocked the way as
long as she could to a Magyar officer, while the
prisoners, weak as they were, fell like beasts on
the unexpected treat.</p>

<p>"We want to see bad men. We show them
we think them bad," the girl said to the officer
in broken Hungarian, smiling sweetly.</p>

<p>He smiled in return and, nodding his approval
of the sentiment, let the girls stay long
enough for all evidences of what they had done,
except the brighter looks of the prisoners, to
have vanished.</p>

<p>Even harder to bear than the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
what their loved ones might be suffering in
battle, was to see the younger children sicken
because of lack of proper food. Ruzena was
one of these. She became so ill that the family
were seriously alarmed. She refused to
eat the coarse food which was the village's daily
ration and piteously begged for something
different. There was nothing else to offer.</p>

<p>"Do go to Janik's," the mother one day bade
Jozef, quite in despair, "and see if they haven't
some little bit of a thing they could let us have
to tempt her."</p>

<p>Janik's mother was full of sympathy but
vainly searched her cupboards. At last she
sent Janik with Jozef to see if there might not
be some winter vegetable rolled in some corner
of the cellar.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i122.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="Boy on floor holding something up to his woman with girl in bed beside him" />
<div class="caption">"HE DROPPED HIS TREASURE AT RUZENA'S BEDSIDE"</div>
</div>
<p>The boys searched but found nothing. As
they were leaving there suddenly flashed upon
Jozef a recollection of how he had hidden a
private store some distance in the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
passages. Hastily leaving Janik without any
explanation, he ran excitedly to his mother.</p>

<p>"Give me the key to our cellar quick, quick,
mother!" he panted.</p>

<p>His mother stared. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>But Jozef grasped the key without answering
and ran. Trembling, he lit the lantern and
made his way into the passage opening, to find
that the earth had fallen, barring the way.</p>

<p>Running out again, he leaped into the courtyard,
and seized a shovel, not glancing at his
mother, although conscious that she stood close
to the window gazing out, her face full of
alarm.</p>

<p>Again he went into the cellar. Little by
little the hardened earth was shoveled away
under his feeble grasp, until he was able to
crawl into the opening. The air smelled close
and moldy. "One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;" Jozef
counted the ten steps which he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
having taken and looked around. No food
was to be seen. He searched for the shelves&mdash;but
they also had vanished.</p>

<p>Dumbfounded and sadly disappointed, he retraced
his steps.</p>

<p>But instead of getting back to the opening,
he unexpectedly found himself in another
passage, and there, oh, joy! his food!</p>

<p>Loading his arms, he staggered out. Without
locking the cellar door, he made his way
dizzily across the street.</p>

<p>"Thanks be to the blessed Virgin!" exclaimed
his mother in the midst of her amazement
as he sank on his knees and dropped his
treasure at Ruzena's bedside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>UNCLE JOZEF'S STORY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> drafted in July, 1915, and sent with
others to a Hungarian training camp. We
were not there long before we heard that we
were to go to the front. On the day of departure,
Anka, to whom I am engaged, came
to the station with my mother. There were,
of course, many other women, all with flowers
in their arms and all with eyes red from weeping.
For they did not want us to go to fight
those who had done us no harm. My father,
who had always been a great patriot, could not
come, but he sent me these words which he had
painstakingly copied from our greatest poet:</p>

<p>"It is shameful when in misery to moan
over our fate; he who by his deeds appeases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the wrath of Heaven, acts better. Not from
a tearful eye but from a diligent hand fresh
hope will blossom. Thus even evil may yet be
changed to good."</p>

<p>Later this fell into the hands of a German,
but he did not understand it. I did.</p>

<p>It was hard to part. My mother, in the
midst of her uncontrollable sobs, whispered:</p>

<p>"Jozef, when the time comes, you know
what you must do."</p>

<p>It was hard to part. At the end, Anka gave
me some red and white ribbon, the Czech and
Slovak colors, which I tied around my rifle. It
did not remain there long, for when the Magyar
captain in charge of our battalion saw it, he
swore savagely, and taking his saber, cut it off
and stamped it under his heels. Not satisfied,
he deliberately hit me a blow from which I
suffered for many days. At the same time he
muttered: "Take care what you are about,
you Slovak dog!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>My companions were as indignant as myself
at the insult to our colors to which we have
every right. "If a time comes when we can
revenge ourselves, we'll not forget," we
promised one another.</p>

<p>By this time we had all heard, somehow, of
Czechs and Slovaks who refused to fight
against the Allies, declaring that they had not
voted for the War, and ought not to be compelled
to fight; and of many Czech and Slovak
desertions. Just before we left, there was
fiendish rejoicing among the Austrian Germans
and Magyars, because a Czech regiment, intending
to desert to the Russians, had been
trapped, and all the officers and every tenth
private shot. The story did not frighten us
or make us less determined to surrender if
opportunity offered. Better to be shot, we told
ourselves, than to serve those who in victory
would treat our people still worse than they
had already done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>We got to the front at Rovno and all that
day were kept working without a morsel to
eat. We had just finished entrenching ourselves,
when Russian shrapnel blew over us.</p>

<p>Towards morning, I heard shouting. Soon
after I saw a bearded Russian with a long
bayonet, standing over me. I tried to tell him
I was a friend, but he had no time to listen, for
Austrian machine gun shot began to come from
the rear, and, with others, I was taken to a
wood not far away.</p>

<p>It was already full of prisoners. As soon
as we came, the Austrian and Magyar prisoners
pitched into us, claiming that what had happened
was the fault of those "Czech and
Slovak cowards." Even here, the Germans
and Austrians blustered and tried to order us
about.</p>

<p>We were very hungry, but nothing was given
us to eat until we reached Rovno. Here we
received a little, several of us sharing one bowl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
After that we were marched to Kiev, a distance
between two hundred and three hundred miles.
We still had very little to eat, for Magyars and
Austrian Germans had not yet got over their
notion of being superior people and so entitled
to more than we. When we complained, they
even beat us. One poor fellow who had
grabbed a loaf of bread from a Magyar who
had two, was found next morning with his
throat cut.</p>

<p>Our prison camp was at Darnica, near the
city. It was just a big field with some trees,
surrounded by barb wire. I remained here
about two weeks when, because workmen were
needed and because of Czecho-Slovak efforts in
Petrograd, we were allowed to volunteer for
work on farms or in ammunition factories.</p>

<p>I chose the latter and came to Kiev. I had
not been in the city long, before I heard that
Czech and Slovak prisoners were being organized
to join a so-called Hussite legion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was made up of Czech and Slovak residents of
Russia, who had already rendered valuable
assistance to the Russians as scouts. The
Russian authorities had been opposed to the
plan at first, not caring to encourage revolutionaries,
even though not Russian revolutionaries.
However, in the end, a grudging consent
was given. I wished to join, but was not
permitted to leave my work.</p>

<p>Then the Revolution came, and, as the
prisoners were freed, the Czechs and Slovaks
flocked to their own colors, and I with them.
If I live forever I shall never forget how I felt
when I found myself among my own people, our
red and white flag waving over us, and heard
the band play our "Kde domov muj."</p>

<p>When we had to swear our oath of loyalty
to Francis Joseph before leaving Austria-Hungary,
all Czech and Slovak soldiers
mumbled the words. When we swore the oath
of obedience to Prof. Masaryk, "the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
father," as we called him, who had come to
Russia, we shouted it so joyously and loudly
that the people from around came to see what
all the noise was about.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>UNCLE JOZEF'S STORY CONTINUED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> so happy now. Every morning I
awakened with a smile on my lips and a song
in my heart. For were we not going to free
our dear, our native land, of the usurper? We
again sang our native songs, which we had not
been allowed to sing in the land of our birth;
sang them so often that we came to be known
as "The Singing Czecho-Slovaks." Whatever
state we came from, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia,
or Slovakia, we were quite united now, and had
only one word for each other and that word
was "Brother."</p>

<p>And in the spirit in which we sang, we also
fought. No longer did the Germans and Magyars
call us cowards. They now called us
"red and white devils," because of the colors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on our hats. At the famous charge at Zborov,
there was almost a religious exaltation as we
marched to the field singing the glorious hymn
of the Hussites: "All Ye Warriors of God."
Here we captured sixty-two officers, and three
thousand one hundred and fifty soldiers, fifteen
guns and many machine guns, turning most of
the latter against the enemy.</p>

<p>But our bravery did little good, the Russians
were deserting the army so fast.</p>

<p>In 1917, I was slightly wounded. This prevented
my taking part in the terrible battle at
Tarnapol, in Galicia, where our men were entirely
abandoned by the Russian troops. It
was a wonderful charge they made, the men
rushing in where danger was thickest and resisting
to the last, and the officers blowing out
their brains rather than surrender.</p>

<p>When the Germans invaded Bessarabia, before
preparing to resist them, we bound ourselves
by a most sacred oath:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the name of our national honor, in the
name of all that is most dear to us as men and
as Czecho-Slovaks, with full realization of this
step, we swear to fight alongside of our allies
to the last drop of our blood, against all of our
enemies, until we have obtained complete liberation
of our Czecho-Slovak nation, until the
Czech and Slovak lands are reunited into a free
and independent Czecho-Slovak state, until our
nation is absolutely mistress of her destinies.</p>

<p>"We solemnly promise, whatever may be the
danger and whatever may be the circumstances,
without fear and hesitation, never to abandon
the sacred goal of our fight.</p>

<p>"As faithful and honorable soldiers, heirs of
our noble history, cherishing the heroic deeds of
our immortal chiefs and martyrs, Jan Hus and
Jan Zizka of Trocnov, we promise to remain
worthy of them, never to flee from battle, to
shirk no danger, to obey the orders of our
officers, to venerate our flags and standards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
never and under no circumstances beg for our
lives from our enemy and never to surrender
with weapons in our hands, to love our companions
as brothers and to give them aid in
danger, to have no fear of death, to sacrifice
all, even our lives, for the freedom of our
fatherland.</p>

<p>"So freely, without pressure of any sort, we
pledge ourselves to act, and so shall we act.
Such is the duty imposed upon us by honor and
fidelity toward our people and our country."</p>

<p>After the Bolsheviks gained complete control
of the government, the Czecho-Slovak army
numbered sixty thousand. We waited hoping
that things would change for the better, until
the disgusting Peace of Brest-Litovsk, in February,
1918. Then we could not but see that
our only chance of continuing the fight for freedom
was to get to France. Through Professor
Masaryk, free passage to Vladivostok was
granted us by the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no little thing that we undertook to
do. It would have been a big enough enterprise,
even under the most favorable conditions.
There was a journey of over five thousand miles
across Eastern Russia and Asia, and then across
the Pacific, across Canada or the United States,
and finally across the Atlantic. In other
words, we were willing to undertake a trip
around the world in order to fight for freedom.
In the Russian part, we had to procure
our trains and provisions, and negotiate
with practically independent Soviets in every
district.</p>

<p>Since concentration at stations was prohibited,
we started for the Pacific in small detachments.
Everywhere we were urged to join
the Red Guard with promises of high pay and
good living. But although we had little to eat,
we refused the bribe. We were in demand, for
afterwards, Gen. Kornilov, and Kaledines, the
Cossack hetman, each tried to gain our help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Again we refused, unwilling to interfere in
Russian internal affairs.</p>

<p>When we reached Penza, we had a disagreeable
surprise. Being the last to leave the front,
we were well armed and had many cannon,
machine guns and other equipment worth hundreds
of millions of dollars, that would otherwise
have fallen into the hands of the Germans.
These we were asked to surrender on
orders from headquarters, retaining only a few
rifles and a few hand grenades to each train.
So anxious were we to leave Russia without a
fight, that we obeyed the order.</p>

<p>Later we heard that about this same time in
Irkutsk, a train division of our men was surrounded
by three thousand of the Red Guard,
mainly former German and Magyar prisoners,
and under German officers, all well armed and
with many machine guns. Our men had only
one gun to every ten men, but when the German
officer gave the command to shoot, the Czechs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
rushed barehanded at them, captured their
guns, and in half an hour had control of the
station.</p>

<p>Even then the Moscow authorities were
begged by Masaryk, and by the French, British,
and American consuls that our troops be allowed
to proceed in peace. Instead, Trotsky
ordered every Czecho-Slovak soldier caught
with arms to be shot at sight.</p>

<p>At Vertunovka we had a long wait. We
employed it in decorating the box cars in which
we traveled, in ways to remind us of the old
brave days of Jan Hus and Jan Zizka, when
the Czechs of Bohemia held all of astonished
Europe at bay for almost a quarter of a century.
As we worked, we each resolved to
prove ourselves worthy of these ancestors.</p>

<p>Some of the boys added inscriptions to the
decorations, such as, "Long live Little Father
Masaryk and the Allies," and put Czech and
Slovak flags about so that our cars really looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
very nice, each platoon striving to have theirs
the best.</p>

<p>As we made our way, by fair means when we
could, by force when necessary, we found
Magyar and Germans in control everywhere.
Our very own first conflict came when a Magyar
in a train of prisoners hit one of our men with
a piece of iron, injuring him very seriously.
We thought him killed and rushed to the train
and demanded the surrender of the murderer.
This led to more trouble. We had few arms,
but took up rocks and followed the train into
the city, singing as we marched. The Soviet
buildings were deserted when we reached them,
and evidently in a hurry, for we found some
rifles which we seized with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>After this delay we resolved to pay no more
attention to delays ordered by the Bolsheviki,
but to push on as quickly as possible to
Vladivostok. Fighting now began in earnest.
Everywhere success was with us. Our spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would allow of no defeat. When we were
menaced, we took the enemy by surprise; we
had set out to get to France and we intended
getting to France, no matter what difficulties we
had to meet and conquer. We seized trains;
we took city after city. While the Bolshevik
propaganda failed to appeal to us, it was not
it so much we fought as the objection of its
supporters to, and lack of comprehension of
our love of country. We knew that the
Magyars and the Germans who were with the
Russian Bolsheviks, fought us not so much because
of our lack of sympathy with the doctrines
they professed, as because of our
nationality.</p>

<p>In the meantime, our forces constantly grew
by means of new recruits. Our fame grew also
as we advanced. Sometimes the mere rumor
that the Czecho-Slovaks were coming, caused
the enemy to flee. And all through Siberia, we
were welcomed by the real inhabitants as deliverers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
By the end of two weeks, three
thousand miles of railroad were in our hands.</p>

<p>Then, when finally we reached Vladivostok,
on the Pacific, we found that we were not to go
to France after all, that the Allies thought we
had a more important work to do where we
were, especially in keeping the railroad, and
hence the wealth of Siberian grain and mineral,
from reaching the Central Powers. This was
also fighting for liberty, and, without a murmur,
we accepted our new duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>THE CZECHO-SLOVAK REPUBLIC</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was October, and Jozef's godfather had
gone again to Bohemia, this time as a delegate
representing the Slovak National Council.
The Czecho-Slovak National Alliance and its
army had been recognized formally some time
before as an ally by the great powers and
greater events were scheduled to follow.</p>

<p>When he reached beautiful "hundred-towered"
Praha, the capital, he found the
streets and coffee houses jammed with people.
Every face had an expectant look in which
anxiety and confidence were blended. Toward
the end of the month their expectations were
realized. The National Council took over the
government of the Czecho-Slovak countries,
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
them formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy.</p>

<p>It was a bloodless revolution, for the Austrian
Government realized the hopelessness of
its position.</p>

<p>All the great sufferings through which they
had passed&mdash;the hunger, the fear, the grief&mdash;were
forgotten by the people in the great
joy of their liberation. Old men embraced
each other; old women wept in each other's
arms with happiness that they had lived to see
the day. People from all the states, with their
slight variations of dialect, were there; Czechs,
Moravians, Czecho-Silesians, and Slovaks.
The ties of close kinship were felt as never
before.</p>

<p>Crowds stood on the big St. Vaclav Square
listening to the Proclamation of Independence
from the steps of the splendid National
Museum. When the reading came to an end,
the people, with one voice, sang the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Czech choral to St. Vaclav, Bohemia's patron
saint.</p>

<p>Almost every hour a new report came: now
that the Emperor's Governor had fled; now that
the Magyar soldiers, who had been stationed
in the city, cared for nothing except to be
allowed to return to Hungary; now that the
commanders of the local garrison had put themselves
at the disposal of the Czecho-Slovak
government.</p>

<p>Similar scenes took place in the historical
Old Town Square, around the splendid monument
of John Hus, that three years before had
had to be unveiled by stealth. Men, women,
and children felt that the noble past of which
Czechs have always been so proud, was come
again. Pride swelled their hearts, too, that all
that they were gaining had come to them
through efforts and sacrifices of their own, so
great that the world had been forced to recognize
and admire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day the Slovak delegates
were received officially, thus uniting the two
branches of the Czecho-Slovak nation.</p>

<p>The first act of the new state was to declare
a republican form of Government with Thomas
Garigue Masaryk as President.</p>

<p>President Masaryk was to take up his official
residence in the immense royal palace so long
deserted. Carpenters and others were busy
modernizing it.</p>

<p>This palace had lived through unusual
vicissitudes of fortune. Already in the tenth
century, a stone fortified palace stood there, but
it was not until the reign of Bohemia's beloved
King Charles I that it assumed something of
its present form, being modeled by him after
the Louvre of Paris. It was enlarged by King
Vladislav, the principal hall being named after
him. In Rudolph's time other Halls were
added.</p>

<p>After the defeat of the White Mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
when Bohemia lost her independence, it no
longer served as a royal residence, and was
practically deserted. In 1757, it was bombarded,
to be rebuilt and enlarged by Empress
Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>And now the greatest change of all: it was
to be the home of the President of a thoroughly
democratic state.</p>

<p>Many days following were festal days.
People flocked to the churches, particularly to
the Cathedral of St. Vitus, which is one of the
great works of King Charles.</p>

<p>While the young people looked forward to
the future, the old recalled the past.</p>

<p>"Ah, how King Charles in his heavenly home
will rejoice," one bent old woman, supported
on crutches, murmured.</p>

<p>"And saintly Vaclav, too," scarcely breathed
another so emaciated that she looked like a
moving shadow. "He'll be proud now that
Bohemia is called after him the Realm of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Vaclav. Ah, I must see once more those
precious relics we have kept of him."</p>

<p>With difficulty she made her way to the
Cathedral where St. Vaclav's helmet, sword,
and coat of mail have been religiously preserved.</p>

<p>Jozef's godfather sent him several picture
postcards reminding him of Jozef's hero, King
Charles. One represented the historic stone
bridge, which Charles had had built with such
care that he did not live to see it finished. On
this card he wrote:</p>

<p>"All the statues on the bridge have a dazed
expression. I wonder what they think of the
change."</p>

<p>Another card was of the old walls of Praha,
working on which through the King's care
saved a thousand men from starving in a time
of famine.</p>

<p>"I walked past these fortifications early one
morning," was the message, "and hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
birds were among the ruins, all singing the news
of our glorious resurrection."</p>

<p>The third card showed Karluv Tyn, built by
Charles for the protection of the crown jewels
and the charters of Bohemia. This beautiful
castle stands not far from Praha, on a rock of
jasper a thousand feet above the River Mze.
To it the King-Emperor sometimes retired for
the meditative devotion which he found so
helpful. On this card the message was the
longest:</p>

<p>"Charles did more than build beautiful
castles and splendid cathedrals. He welcomed
men of learning and made higher education
possible even for the poor by founding the
University of Praha, the first university in all
of Central Europe. He freed the land of
robbers; he secured justice to the peasants by
making it possible for them to appeal to the
King from the decision of their own feudal
lords. His name has come down to us revered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and beloved, because of the many evidences of
his unselfish, constant thought for the people's
welfare."</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence, on the very day that
the last postcard came to Jozef in Slovakia,
another reached him from his friend, Jaroslav.
It was dated from the famous watering place,
Carlsbad, in northern Bohemia, where Jaroslav
had accompanied his father, who had some
business there.</p>

<p>"The Germans here, who have largely control
of things," it stated, "are angry at the turn
affairs have taken. They clamor about the
rights of the minority, they who never considered
the rights of the Slavic majority. But
I think they are calming down, for they see that
they're going to get justice. The Czechs are
not revengeful. If we treated them as they
treated us&mdash;whew!" He said no more of
the Germans, but humorously described some of
the patients he had seen; some very fat, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
very thin, all expecting cure from digestive disturbances.</p>

<p>A few days before he left, Jozef's godfather
took one more walk across the sixteen-arched
statue decorated Charles Bridge (Karluv
most), through the picturesque Little Side, with
its quaint old-time palaces of nobles, up a steep
and winding street to the Hradcany, as the
group of buildings around the royal palace together
with it, is called.</p>

<p>From these heights, Praha is seen in all its
wondrous beauty lying on both sides of the
River Vltava (Moldau). It seems an endless
succession of parks, gardens, queer roofs that
are the delight of every artist that sees them,
and innumerable towers and steeples. Across
the river he could see the rocky Vysehrad, the
seat of the early rulers. It was there that
Libusa, the reputed founder of Praha, made her
famous prophecy: "Lo, before me I see a
city whose glory reaches to the skies!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>He mused at the great richness not only in
Bohemia's real historic past but in her legendary
lore; how everything about the city has
its story. On the hills towards which he
was turned, Vlasta, the leader of an Amazon
band, made her stand in the early days
against Prince Premysl; near him was the
tower of Daliborka, where a noble was once
imprisoned and said to have found solace in
a violin. Since then ghostly music is said to
haunt the place. Of the alchemists who lived
near by in the Street of Gold, a street of
the tiniest, most brightly-hued houses imaginable,
he recalled the strange tales told. In the
very courts of the palace, legends mingled with
history.</p>

<p>A peculiar feeling that he had never experienced
before came over him. To live in Praha,
he felt, was not the prosaic, everyday life he
had always known; it was living a brightly
colored romance too disturbing for him to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
used to now. His own dear Slovakia, with its
quiet, simple life, was better for him.</p>

<p>The next day the new President arrived from
abroad, and was installed in office. That was
the greatest day of all in Praha. The feeling
of the multitude was expressed by one old man
who said, "I shall weep no more for my dead,
since they helped make the fairy tale come true
that brutal force no longer rules, that a proud,
deserving nation is freed at last from a bondage
to which so long the world was indifferent."</p>
